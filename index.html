			<h1>GIF vs. JPEG</h1>
			<h2> by:Carter Johnson </h2>
			<h3>A GIF file saves photos and usually contains photo files, this format is commonly used for pictures or short animations.

			A JPEG file saves photos and contains photo files, this format is the most popular way to save photos.</h3>

		<h3>Format History</h3>
			<p>GIF: The original GIF format was called GIF 87a and was published by CompuServe in 1987. A couple of years later, the company updated the format and named it GIF 98a. It was the second iteration that included support for transparent backgrounds and the storing of metadata (Fisher).  Similar formats made during this time was the JPEG file and the PNG file.  The GIF file is still in use and is one of the most popular file formats to this day.  It is a open source format and you do not need to pay to use a GIF.

			JPEG:  JPEG was created by the Joint Photographic Experts Group in 1986.  Similar formats created around this time were GIFs and PNGs.  The JPEG format is still in use today and is currently the most popular way to save photos.  It is completely open source and requires no money to save a picture in a JPEG file (Svetlik).</p>
		<h3>Compression</h3>
			<p>GIF: GIF is a lossy image format that uses the LZW compression algorithm (Nanwani).  The average GIF file size is 500kb before compression and after is about 50 kb. On average the file compresses about 90% of the image.

               JPEG:  JPEG is a lossy image format that saves digital photography. Before it is compressed it’s at an average 500 kb but after compression it’s at about 75 kb. On average the file compression is 85% (Fisher).</p>
		<h3>Similar Format Advantages/Disadvantages</h3>
            <p>Some Similar formats from JPEG and GIF are TIFF, PNG, and RAW.  Since GIF files are usually limited in the number of colors they can display (just 256), other graphic formats like JPG, which can store many more colors (millions), are usually used for full images like those created with a digital camera. GIF files, then, are used on websites when there doesn't need to be a massive range of colors, like for buttons or banners (Fisher).  Some advantages they have over similar formats are that JPEG and GIF are that GIF can represent transparency into a image, and JPEG can compress the most amount of color without losing quality on the image.</p>
